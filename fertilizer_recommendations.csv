0.0,0.2,"Apply organic amendments like Compost (5-7.5 tonnes/ha), Vermicompost (2.5-3.5 tonnes/ha), or Well-decomposed Farmyard manure (10-12.5 tonnes/ha). Incorporate green manure crops like Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) (5-6 tonnes/ha), Sunhemp (Crotalaria juncea) (4-5 tonnes/ha), or Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) (3-4 tonnes/ha). Avoid applying chemical fertilizers until soil health improves."
0.2,0.4,"Apply organic amendments like Compost (3-5 tonnes/ha), Vermicompost (1.5-2.5 tonnes/ha), or Well-decomposed Farmyard manure (7.5-10 tonnes/ha). Use biofertilizers like Rhizobium (200-300 g/ha), Azotobacter (200-300 g/ha), and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) (500-750 g/ha). Apply chemical fertilizers at 50% of the recommended dose based on soil test results."
0.4,0.6,"Apply organic amendments like Compost (2-3 tonnes/ha), Vermicompost (1-1.5 tonnes/ha), or Well-decomposed Farmyard manure (5-7.5 tonnes/ha). Use biofertilizers like Rhizobium (200-300 g/ha), Azotobacter (200-300 g/ha), and PSB (500-750 g/ha). Apply chemical fertilizers at 75% of the recommended dose based on soil test results and crop requirements."
0.6,0.8,"Apply organic amendments like Compost (1-2 tonnes/ha) or Vermicompost (0.5-1 tonne/ha). Follow integrated nutrient management practices. Apply chemical fertilizers like Urea (0.08-0.12 tonnes/ha), Single Superphosphate (0.06-0.09 tonnes/ha), and Muriate of Potash (0.04-0.06 tonnes/ha) as per soil test recommendations and crop requirements."
0.8,1.0,"Maintain soil health by incorporating Crop residues (2-3 tonnes/ha) and applying organic amendments like Compost (0.5-1 tonne/ha) or Vermicompost (0.25-0.5 tonne/ha). Apply chemical fertilizers judiciously based on soil test results and crop needs. Consider using slow-release fertilizers like Neem-coated Urea (0.04-0.06 tonnes/ha) or Sulfur-coated Urea (0.03-0.05 tonnes/ha) to improve nutrient use efficiency."
